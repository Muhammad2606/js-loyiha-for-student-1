                        Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance: a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc.,
                         performed in a theatre, or on radio or television.[1] Considered as a genre of poetry in general,
                          the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's 
                          Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.[2] The term "drama" comes from a Greek 
                          word "draō" meaning "to do / to act" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from "I do"
                           (Classical Greek: δράω, drao). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic
                            division between comedy and tragedy. In English (as was the analogous case in many other European 
                            languages), the word play or game.
